This repository contains a virtual lab prototype designed to simulate the measurement and calculation of the band gap energy of a material. The lab includes interactive features that allow users to explore the relationship between temperature and electrical conductivity, and determine the band gap energy using experimental data.

The project aims to provide an educational tool for students to understand the concept of band gap energy and its significance in material science. By utilizing basic physics principles, users can calculate the slope of the temperature vs. conductivity graph, which is used to estimate the band gap energy of the material.

Key Features:
Interactive Graphing Tool: Allows users to input data and visualize the relationship between temperature and conductivity.
Band Gap Calculation: Calculates the band gap energy using the formula: 
ùê∏ùëî=2√ó0.198√óslopeEg = 2√ó0.198√óslope, where the slope is derived from the graph.
Real-time Output: Displays the calculated slope and band gap energy as results on the screen.
This project is a prototype and can be further expanded to include other materials or more advanced features for a deeper understanding of semiconductor physics.
